## Privacy Policy | Hush-Hush

This page describes the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information by us and third-party services used in the app. By choosing to use our app, you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy.

### Information collection and use

- **Data collected by us [Hush-Hush] which is required for the product functionality**  
We use [Firebase Database solution](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy#:~:text=Firebase%20restricts%20access%20to%20a,In%20and%202%2Dfactor%20authentication.) to store data collected by us. This database server is located in the US.

  - **Anonymous user id**  
Users of Hush-Hush (web and app) are not required to create any accounts. However to map user data such as wishlist and groups to users, each user is assigned a random anonymous identifier which are known as anonymous accounts. If the user uninstalls or clears all the app data of the app from mobile settings, a new anonymous identifier is assigned to the user when they install or use the app again and the data that the user previously entered in the app can no longer be traced to that user. Thus these accounts are anonymous.  
We use [Firebase Authentication Service](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy#:~:text=Firebase%20restricts%20access%20to%20a,In%20and%202%2Dfactor%20authentication.) which provides a server to create and maintain such accounts. Periodically, we initiate an automatic deletion of accounts from the server if the user is inactive for more than a month and isn't present in any of the groups. After initiating deletion, the data is removed from Firebase's live and backup systems within 180 days. We detect and collect online/offline status of these accounts to aid us in determining inactive status of users.  

  - **Groups**  
Groups created in the app have details such as group name, celebration date, budget, these are stored in our database. Along with this, any participant data (name and wishlist) which is added in the group by web user or app user gets stored in our database. Here, name is stored in plain text and wishlist is stored in encrypted format (not end-to-end encrypted) in our database. Wishlist has fields such as wishes and notes. Users are responsible for any data they share in these fields as these are generic fields.  
This data is subject to deletion anytime after 90 days from the date of creation of the data. This deletion process is performed automatically at our end. In other words, this data is not permanently stored in our database. Additionally, users who have created groups (group admins) have an option to delete individual participant data or whole group.

  - **Wishlists and Giftees in app**  
The app has three tabs out of which two are wishlists and giftees. Data present in these two tabs are stored in the user's device and are not sent to us. The wishlists created in the wishlist tab are stored in the user's device only. The giftees list is populated by extracting giftee information from groups (from our server), these giftees then are stored in the user's device. Users can delete wishlists and giftees anytime.

- **Data collected by third-party services**  
We use few third-party services listed below that may collect certain information. The type of information collected by these third-party services, their practices and instructions on how to opt-out of certain options is given below.  
Our privacy policy does not apply to third-party services used by us. Thus, we advise you to consult the respective Privacy Policies of these third-party services for more detailed information.

  - **Firebase Crashlytics**  
We use crash reporting services offered by Google LLC. Crashlytics helps collecting, analyzing and organizing app crash reports. In a case of an app crash, Crashlytics transmits certain technical information to us. This data may include information such as your device model, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing the application, the time and date of the crash, and other statistics.

  - **Google AdMob**  
AdMob is a mobile advertising company which is a subsidiary of Google LLC. We use advertisements to support our app.  
Google may use the advertising ID from the device on which the ad is serving to generate interests and demographics (for example, 'sports enthusiasts'). Interests, demographics, and other data may be used to serve better personalized ads.
